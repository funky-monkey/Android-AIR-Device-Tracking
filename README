A way to use AIR for Android (for Android / iPad / iPhone) in combination with Google Analytics to track pages/application screens without using Javascript but by directly calling Googles tracking pixel. Included is a PHP file and an AS3 Class to make the calls.

Place the tracking.php file on your own server and edit the following lines 

$var_utmac='UA-000000-00'; //enter the new urchin code
$var_utmhn='yourdomain.com'; //enter your domain

and adjust them in such a way that it uses your tracking code and your domain name.

If you are using a newly created tracking code from within GA, make sure you test/activate it first. You can do this by pasting your tracking ID in the tracking_test.html. Look for this line

_gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-000000-00']);

Where the UA begins is your tracking ID. Paste your code here.

Usage:
// Setup tracking
UrchinTracker.setApplicationName(DocumentClass.APPLICATION_NAME);
UrchinTracker.setDomain("http://yourdomain.ext");

// Do actual tracking
UrchinTracker.trackDevicePage(AnalyticsPageNames.SPLASH_PAGE);
